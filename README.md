# Differentiable Programming for Modeling and Control of Dynamical Systems
## Full Day Workshop at the 2023 American Control Conference ([ACC](https://acc2023.a2c2.org/))

In recent years there has been an explosion of research on the intersection of machine learning and classical engineering domains. Machine learning is increasingly being used in the development of novel data-driven approaches for modeling and control of dynamical systems, traditionally dominated by physics-based models and scientific computing solvers. On the other hand, engineering and scientific computing principles are changing the machine learning landscape from purely black-box into domain-aware methods by incorporating more structure and prior knowledge into their model architectures and loss functions. 

Differentiable Programming has emerged as a leading paradigm for systematically integrating converging domains of machine learning and scientific computing based on a shared infrastructure that is built on automatic differentiation of complex computer programs. It has ushered in a new epoch in scientific machine learning with structured domain-aware model architectures, signaling a paradigm shift away from over-parametrized black-box deep neural models. This has spurred the development of software tools and algorithms to construct differentiable programs for both general and specific tasks to achieve:
- Surrogate modeling via systematic combination of black-box function approximators such as deep neural networks with physics-based equations.
- Expressive functions that incorporate structure and priors of the problem to make the learning process more robust and data efficient.
- Analysis of data-driven models by leveraging classical numerical methods.
- New architectures to advance machine learning capabilities, such as modeling physical systems with guarantees and generating safe control actions.
- Differentiable physics simulators allowing for solution of inverse modeling and optimal control problems. 

This workshop brings together pioneers and leaders in this emerging area of differentiable programming to gather their perspectives on  nonlinear dynamical systems modeling, constrained optimization, and control. Our intention is to build synergy between research teams working on the theory, tools, and algorithms in this area for different applications, including buildings, energy systems, climate models, healthcare, robotics, and vision, to name a few. We hope the talks pique further interest in this topic leading to exciting new research directions and wider adoption of domain-aware differentiable architectures.

We believe the workshop will be of great interest to: 
- Deep learning researchers seeking to model and control physical systems with end-to-end differentiable components.
- Students exploring the practical applications of differentiable programs for  learning and control.
- Practitioners interested in benchmarking differentiable environments, software libraries, and deep learning programming practices for dynamical systems and control applications.
